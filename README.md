# Restnet_MODEL
Built a fifty layers deep convolutional neural network with residual blocks, to classify digits on Finger Signs Detection Dataset (from Kaggle). The skip-connections in residual blocks make training of very deep neural networks feasible and also address the vanishing gradient problem faced during the training of extremely deep neural nets.
